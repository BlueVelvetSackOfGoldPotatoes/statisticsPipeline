What is the relationship, correlation between the variables

Use the values of the correlation and relationship tests to
create premises for the logic in prolog

Prolog can then be the expert system to ask questions

In turn, this system must be dynamic such that when new data comes
around values are updated and new logic is in place

# Different types of situations require different types of frameworks for statistical testing:
Continuous vs categorical (or discrete in case of nominal data)
multiple dependent vs 1 dependent variable
multiple independent vs 1 independent variable

# t-test
A statistical test used to compare the means of two groups of data. T-tests are used when the data sets follow a normal distribution and have unknown variances, like the data set recorded from flipping a coin 100 times.
## Paired Sample T-Test
The correlated t-test, or paired t-test, is performed in dependent variables when the samples consist of matched pairs of similar units, or when there are cases of repeated measures. For example, there may be instances where the same patients are repeatedly tested before and after receiving a particular treatment. Each patient is being used as a control sample against themselves.
## Unequal Variance T-Test
The unequal variance t-test is used in independent variables when the number of samples in each group is different, and the variance of the two data sets is also different. This test is also called Welch's t-test.
## Equal Variance or Pooled T-Test
The equal variance t-test is used in independent variables when the number of samples in each group is the same, or the variance of the two data sets is similar.

# chi-squared test
Measures how a model compares to actual observed data.
The data used in calculating a chi-square statistic must be random, raw, mutually exclusive, drawn from independent variables, and drawn from a large enough sample. For example, the results of tossing a fair coin meet these criteria.


# Anova
Analysts use the ANOVA test to determine the influence that independent variables have on the dependent variable in a regression study. If no real difference exists between the tested groups, which is called the null hypothesis, the result of the ANOVA's F-ratio statistic will be close to 1.
## One-way Anova
The one-way ANOVA is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups.
## Two-way Anova
In two-way Anova, the effect of two independent variables on one dependent variable is being tested.
## Manova
This is an extension of Anova - it allows for the bundling of dependent variables and analyses the effects of an independent variable on their variance. 

# Pearson Correlation test
Pearson's correlation coefficient is the test statistics that measures the statistical relationship, or association, between two continuous variables, assumed to have a linear relationship. 

# Spearman Correlation test
Spearman's correlation test measures the statistical relationship between two continuous or discrete variables while assuming no distribution.
